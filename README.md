Hello everyone!

My first repo encompasses all I have learnt in SoftUni starting as from Jul 2022 following the professional path for Python Full Stack Developers. In brief the 2-years course include:

1. Programming basics (Python)
  - Basics of Python Syntax
  - Conditional Statements
  - 'For' and 'While' Loops
  - Nested Loops
  
  2. Programming Fundamentals (Python)
    - Conditional Statements and loops
